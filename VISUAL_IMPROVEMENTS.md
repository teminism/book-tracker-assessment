# Visual Improvements for Book Tracker

The layout is clean and the sidebar navigation works well. But there are definitely some UX/UI improvements that would make it feel way more polished and user-friendly. 

## Navigation & Layout

- I'd improve the consistentency between cards, settings sections, and charts so everything feels balanced.
- Make the active sidebar item stand out more with a stronger highlight.
- Allow the sidebar to collapse to icons only, which helps on smaller screens.

## Book Display & Interaction

- Show reading progress with a small progress bar under the title.

- The current notes display is pretty cramped. A collapsible section or modal for longer notes would keep the interface clean while allowing detailed thoughts. 

- Suggesting books by the same author or similar genres would help users discover new content.

- Having better default covers or the ability to search for covers online would make the library look much more polished.

## Mobile Experience

- Some buttons and interactive elements are a bit small for mobile. Larger touch targets would improve usability on phones and tablets. 


## Visual Polish

- Skeleton screens or subtle loading animations would make it feel more polished. Right now it just kinda freezes.

With these changes, the Book Tracker can grow from being just a functional tool into something people genuinely look forward to using. Right now it already works well, but with a little extra polish and personality, it could feel less like a utility and more like a companion for readers, something that makes tracking books fun and rewarding.
